=====================
Storage Formats
=====================
Stored as plain text files. TEXTFILE is the default file format, unless the configuration parameter "hive.default.fileformat"

=====================
Partitioned Table
=====================
Partitioned tables can be created using PARTITIONED BY Clause. A Table can have one or more partition columns and separate data
directory is created for each distinct value combination in the partition columns. further tables or partitions can be bucketed 
using CLUSTERED BY columns, and data can be stored within that bucket via SORT BY columns. This can improve performance on
certain kinds of queries.

"FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Column repeated in partition columns," It's means you are try to include the partitioned 
column in the data of the table itself. so the Partition column can't be included in Table's definition, so the partition column
should be a pseudocolumn)

============================
How to load data into Hive Partition Table
============================
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH /tmp/pv_2008-06-08_us.txt INTO TABLE page_view PARTITION(date='2008-06-08', country='US')


===================
External Tables
===================
EXTERNAL keywords lets you create a table and provide a LOCATION so that Hive does not use a default location for
this table.

An EXTERNAL table points to any HDFS location for its storage, rather than being stored in a folder specified by 
the configuration property hive.metastore.warehouse.dir.

Examples
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE page_view(viewTime int, userid BIGINT,
                                page_url STRING,
                                reference_url STRING,
                                ip STRING COMMENT 'IP Address of the User',
                                country STRING COMMENT 'country of origination')
  comment 'This is the staging page view table'
  row format delimited fields terminated by ','
  stored as textfile
  LOCATION '<hdfs_location>';
