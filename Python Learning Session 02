Define Functions in Python
We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary.

>>> def fib(n):
... a, b = 0,1
... while a < n:
...    print a,
...    a, b = b, a+b
...
>>> 
... fib(2000)

The Keyword "def" introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of 
formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.
