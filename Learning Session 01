                                  Python Learning Notes (offical website https://www.python.org)

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but
effective approach to objec-oriented programming.

Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and 
rapid application development in many areas on most platform

1. Python's Interpreter
   Python Interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python 
   in the system prompt, you can type the 'python' to execute the Interpreter
   Typing an end-of-file character(Control-D on Unix and Control-Z on Windows) if that doesn't work
   you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command quit().
   
   When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into 
   a list of strings and assigned to the 'argv' variable in the sys module. Developer can access this list
   by executing 'import sys'. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given
   sys.argv[0] is an empty string. when the script name is given as '-'(meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is
   set to '-'. when -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'.

2. Source Code Encoding
   It is possible to use encodings different than ASCII in Python source files. The best way to do it is to
   put one more special comment line right after the #! line to define the source file encoding:
   # -*- coding: encoding -*-
   
3. Introduction to Python
   3.1 Using Python as a Calculator
   Let's try some Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. 
   3.1.1 Numbers
   The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
   Expression syntax is straightforward. The operators +,-,* and / work just like in most other language.
   
   >>> 2 + 2
   4
   >>> 50 - 5*6
   20
   >>>(50 - 5.0*6)/4
   5.0
   >>> 8 / 5.0
   1.6
   The integer numbers(4,20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part(e.g. 5.0,1.6) have type float.
   The return type of a division(/) operation depends on its operands. if both operands are of type int,
   floor division is performed and an int is returned. if either operand is float, classic division is performed 
   and a float is returned. 
   
   The // operator is also provided for doing floor division no matter what the operands are. for example
   >>> 17 // 3.0 # explicit floor division discards the fractional part.
   5.0
   The remainder can be calculated with the % operator.
   With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers
   >>> 5 ** 2 # 5 squared
   25
   >>> 2 ** 7 # 2 to the power of 7
   128
